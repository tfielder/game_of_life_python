## Rules
* For a space that is 'populated':
* Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
* Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
* For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
* Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.

Sample input = [[1,0,1],
                [0,1,1],
                [1,1,0]
                ]
